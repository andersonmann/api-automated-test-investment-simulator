The endpoint http://5b847b30db24a100142dce1b.mockapi.io/api/v1/simulador, return the following error: "Max number of elements reached for this resource!"
The number of inserts has exceeded the limit. For this reason it was not possible to carry out the complete development.
I opened a issue in github. (https://github.com/WoopSicredi/jobs/issues)

A similar error already happened, as can be seen in the link below.
